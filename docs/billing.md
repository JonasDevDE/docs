# Billing

## Prepaid

Our billing concept is based on the prepaid system.
Before you can buy any plan you need to top up your account balance using a payment method (see below).
Once the payment is completed your balance becomes available.

## Accepted payment methods

We provide automatic payments through PayPal on our panel.
It can take some minutes for the payment to be verified. Feel free to contact our [Support](support.md) if
you have any issues.

You can also pay using cryptocurrencies (BTC, LTC, XMR) through a ticket
on our [Discord](https://discord.neoprotect.net).
