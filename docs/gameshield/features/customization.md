# Customization

The customization feature is primarily used to unlock the feature of hiding ourselves as well as perfectly customer-oriented
announcements if your server is offline / not reachable.

## Categories

The customizable messages are split into different categories.

* General - Change messages that are displaying when e.g. a player has a too high version or uses forge or a VPN.
* Mitigation - Change messages that the player will see related to mitigations e.g. from the anti-bot.
* Offline - Here you can change the MOTD & kick message that displays when your server is offline.
* IP Firewall - Change messages that will be shown to players that are not allowed to join the server.
