# Traffic Limits and how they work

We use traffic limits for the majority of our plans, with a rolling reset of 30 days.
This means that we sum the traffic of the **last 30 days**, accurately to the minute.

As soon as your traffic limit is reached, your server will be locked until the next billing period begins.
If you upgrade your plan, while your server is locked, it will be unlocked automatically.

Don't hesitate to contact our [Support](support.md) if you have further questions.
