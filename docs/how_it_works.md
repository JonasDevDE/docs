# How it works

NeoProtect operates a highly available network and reverse proxy service,
sitting between your users and your server(s).

The setup is very quick as you only need to point your domains to our service through the [Panel](https://panel.neoprotect.net).
After that the traffic is routed through our service and only legitimate packets will be forwarded to your server.
Your server is now protected against all kinds of Layer 3/4 and Layer 7 attacks.

Keep in mind that you must not expose your server's IP as that will allow attackers to target your server directly and not through our service.

We protect your server with advanced technology based on two layers of mitigation software.
Both layers provide **permanent mitigation** to keep your server online at all times.
New attacks are analyzed automatically to improve our filters.
