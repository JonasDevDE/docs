# Install Instructions

Here you will find the instructions for installing and setting up the plugin, we assume that you already have knowledge of Minecraft plugins

1) First, stop your server/network and put the plugin jar into the plugins folder.
   Continue by starting your server and note that if there is a folder in the plugins folder called "NeoProtect", 
   don't change anything there.

2) Now join the server while having the permission "neoprotect.admin" when joining 
   and you should now see a message in the chat telling you how to proceed.
